# Blackhole-Simulation-Using-Python
Imagine a black hole sitting in the center of space, surrounded by hundreds of tiny particles—like stars or cosmic dust. This project is a simulation that shows how those particles move under the black hole’s gravity. Depending on how fast the particles are moving at the start, they can either orbit, spiral in, or even escape.
